# Image Studio

Welcome üëã!

**Image Studio** is a pet project of mine where I code a range of different image processing techniques. 
My main goal with Image Studio is to learn more about image processing by coding algorithms that I find interesting from scratch rather than using existing libraries.

## Color Palette Conversion üé®

This feature works similarly to digital [Color Grading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_grading). 

Here's how it works:

1. Grayscale Conversion: The original image is converted to grayscale.

2. Dithering: Dithering is applied to remove color banding.

3. Color Mapping - A [Color LUT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_lookup_table) (Lookup Table) maps each grayscale value to a specific HSV value.


The core idea is to **associate color with a single channel in the image**, rather than with 3 channels, like it is with RGB. This makes it much easier to manipulate color, and for this reason I opted for the [HSV color model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV).

After a **Base Hue** is specified, a **color palette for that Hue will be created on-the-fly**. 

It's also possible to specify a **Hue Range**. This controls how much the available hues in the color palette can deviate from the Base Hue. For more information, read the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/RafaelAmauri/Image-Studio/wiki/Color-Palette-Conversion#hue-range)!

### Some examples:





| **Original Image (Credit to [Keith Griego](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/dKR0xw) on Artstation), 16 Million Colors**  | **Green Color Palette, 32 Colors, Base Hue = 130, Hue Range = 40** | **Blue Color Palette, 32 Colors, Base Hue = 260, Hue Range = 65, Reversed Hue = True** |

## Quantization and Dithering üü• üü© üü¶ üüß üü™

**Quantization** works by reducing the number of colors in an image by grouping similar colors together.  **Quantizing the image without dithering causes major [Color Banding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_banding)**.

**Dithering** is just a fancy way of doing quantization. It works by quantizing the image and then distributing the pixels in a way that creates the illusion of a wider color palette.

I have implemented two dithering algorithms:

* [Floyd-Steinberg algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering)

* [Ordered dithering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_dithering)

## SIMD Acceleration üöÄ

Working with images often requires performing operations on thousands of pixels. Since images are essentially large arrays of pixel data, and the same operations can be applied to many pixels at the same time, 
this makes them **ideal candidates for [SIMD acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data)**.

Implementing SIMD acceleration often requires **major rewrites and optimizations**, and the process is often not very straightforward, but it is still very much worth it!

The speedup I got after implementing vectorization is massive. For reference, my Ryzen 7 5700X3D can **quantize**, **dither** and **convert the color palette of an 8K image in around 15 seconds**. 
Without vectorization, the same operations on the same image took over **20 minutes**. So, in a way, you could say that the code in this repo is **8K-ready**! üòÅ

‚ö†Ô∏è **Vectorization is not the same as multithreading**! Vectorization leverages **[Vector Processors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_processor)** that exist on modern CPUs. 
These Vector Units are optimized for running SIMD code for multiple data at once. **However, SIMD acceleration still runs on a single CPU thread**!

On that note, theoretically speaking the speedup could be even greater if I also implemented **multithreading combined with vectorization** - which would distribute the workload across multiple CPU cores while still using 
SIMD acceleration in each core. However, since my current implementation already processes an **8K image in a very reasonable amount of time**, I haven't prioritized multithreading yet.



## Running the code üõ†Ô∏è

1Ô∏è‚É£ Install the dependencies with

    pip install -r requirements.txt

2Ô∏è‚É£ Next, run the code with

    python3 main.py -i path/to/image


3Ô∏è‚É£ You can specify what operations you want by the command line.  For example, to quantize an image with 8 colors, you could run

    python3 main.py -i path/to/image --quantize 8

For a full list of available options, check out [include/parser.py](include/parser.py). This file contains all the valid operations.
